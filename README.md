# Computing History

[This essay](pdf/essay_two_column.pdf) is a survey of computing history,
made initially as part of my literature review for my dissertation on
*geodemographics*. However my supervisor advised that it strayed too far
from issues of relevance to a Geography PhD. 

The essay covers computing's early precursors such as Babbage's Difference
Engine and Hollerith's Tabulating Machine; the key theoretical
breakthroughs made by Church, Turing and Shannon; the hardware
developments predicted by Moore's Law and the lesser-known Bell's Law;
some important issues in the progress of software; and the foundations of
AI and Machine Learning.
